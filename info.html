                    <strong>Interactive Design:</strong> A digital showroom that not only displays physical models, but allows you to explore each car through augmented reality. 
                    Each customer can "enter" the car, test it, modify it in real time, changing details such as colors, materials and performance, all through touchscreen interfaces or AR viewers.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Intelligent Auto-Configurator:</strong> An advanced configurator that goes beyond the usual aesthetic options, allowing the customer to also select real-time features such as autonomous driving technology, energy efficiency and engine type according to their lifestyle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Virtual and Real Test Drive Area:</strong> A test drive area where customers can first "test" the car in a realistic driving simulator (to test performance), and then go out for a real test drive on the road, assisted by intelligent systems that monitor and analyze every aspect of driving.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Maintenance and Sustainability Center:</strong> An area dedicated to predictive maintenance. Thanks to artificial intelligence and sensors integrated into the vehicles, the dealership offers a maintenance service that notifies customers when it is the right time to carry out checks. 
                    In addition, Evoluzione Motors promotes sustainability with 100% electric vehicles, solar charging stations and advanced recycling solutions for batteries.

                    <strong>Holistic Customer Experience:</strong> The dealership is not just a place to buy a car, but a 360Â° experience. 
                    Modern living rooms, personalized music, gourmet coffee and customer support via AI chatbots are part of a service that aims for maximum satisfaction and convenience.
